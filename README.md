This project focuses on forecasting the volume of Apple stock traded using Time Series Forecasting techniques. The dataset used contains the stock price data of Apple from the NASDAQ stock exchange for selected time periods in 2018 and 2019.

# Problem Description
The goal of this project is to predict the volume of stocks traded based on historical data. By analyzing the trends and patterns in the data, we aim to build accurate forecasting models and evaluate their performance.

# Project Steps
* Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform an initial analysis of the dataset, visualize the time series, and identify any trends, seasonality, or outliers. Conduct seasonal decomposition and create multiple plots to gain insights.

* Model Development: Build various models for forecasting, including ARIMA models with and without exogenous variables, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and Facebook's Prophet library. Train these models using the training data and assess their performance.

* Model Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. Compare the test RMSE values obtained for each model to assess their accuracy.

* Conclusion: Based on the evaluation results, draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the different forecasting models. Determine which model performed the best in terms of forecasting the volume of stocks traded.

# Key Findings
After evaluating the models with optimal (p,d,f values) , the following test RMSE values were obtained:

ARIMA(1, 0, 2) = 1.341957e+07
SARIMA(1, 0, 2)(0, 0, 2) = 1.258622e+07
SARIMAX(1, 0, 2)(0, 0, 2) = 8.368355e+06
Prophet = 1.309688e+07
Prophet with exogenous variables = 7.767959e+06
Based on the test RMSE, it can be concluded that the Prophet model with exogenous variables outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy.

# Enhancements and Future Improvements

* Importance of Time Series Forecasting: Discuss the importance of accurate time series forecasting in financial markets and how it can assist investors, traders, and financial institutions in making informed decisions.

* Improving Model Performance: Explore additional techniques to further improve the forecasting models' performance, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, incorporating domain knowledge, and considering ensemble methods.

* Visualizations and Interpretability: Enhance the project by including more visualizations to interpret the results effectively. Visualize the predicted values against the actual values to showcase the model's performance visually.

* Data Expansion: Consider expanding the dataset by including data from more recent periods to observe the model's performance on recent trends and patterns.

# Conclusion
In this project, we applied various Time Series Forecasting techniques to predict the volume of stocks traded for Apple. We compared different models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, and Prophet, and evaluated their performance using RMSE. The Prophet model with exogenous variables demonstrated the best performance in terms of accuracy.

Time Series Forecasting plays a crucial role in the financial sector, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on predicted future trends. By utilizing pipelines, industry professionals can streamline the model development process and improve efficiency.

The project can be further improved by enhancing visualizations, exploring additional techniques for model improvement, and expanding the dataset to include more recent data.
